# ðŸŒ± Sprout
Sprout is a seed collection app designed for users to manage the seed packets in their collection.

[Sprout Deployment](https://sprout-9da299194677.herokuapp.com)

## ðŸŒ¿ Description
**Tech Used:** MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js

Keeping track of all of the seed packets for gardening can be difficult and frustrating. It is easy to forget what seeds are already owned, what can be planted when, and the information on the packet can fade with time or damage. Sprout was created as a solution to managing seeds.

Sprout is an app that helps users manage their seed packets by allowing them to add the plant information from their seed packet into their collection. Users are able to input:
* Plant Name
* Planting Season
* Plant Type
* Seed Packet Quantity
* Notes

This information is then displayed in the users "My Seed Collection",organized by plant type, where they are able to view all of the plant seeds they own. Users have the ability to:
* Add New Plants
* Edit Existing Plants
* Delete Plants from their collection

Users can also visit the "Plant By Season" page where they can view their collection organized by planting season.

## ðŸª´ Next Steps

* Use a plant API, like Perenual or Trefle, to add an image of the plant as well as additional care information for each plant
* Change the "Plant By Season" page so the user can input the season and only receive the plants for that selected season
*Create an alert for users that provides them with a list of seeds they need to re-stock
